# MiniGrid

The full list of tasks ported to MiniHack from [MiniGrid](https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid) which we used in our experiments is
provided in the table below.

Note that more tasks could have similarly been ported from MiniGrid.
However, our goal is to showcase MiniHack's ability to port existing gridworld environments and easily
enrich them, rather then porting all possible tasks.

Examples of `MultiRoom-N4` and `MultiRoom-N4-Extreme` environments rendered using MiniHack's tiles:
