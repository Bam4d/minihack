# Reward Manager

## Overview
Reward functions in MiniHack can easily be configured. Our \texttt{RewardManager} provides a convenient way to specify one or more events that can provide different (positive or negative) rewards, and control which subsets of events are sufficient or required for episode termination (see \cref{appedix:goal_generator} for further details).
